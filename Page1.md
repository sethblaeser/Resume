***Golf***
  I recently started playing golf and have been devloping my game. My favorite course to play locally is [Tanglewood in Fulton Missouri](https://www.tanglewoodfulton.com/).

***Motocross***
  I grew up racing motocross and it has always been a passion of mine. I started riding dirtbikes when I was 4 years old. Unfortuanitly after my father had an accident I stopped riding. However, I still follow the sport. I grew up racing against [Chase Sexton](https://rxi.iscdn.net/2018/12/175595_175086_fchondadec18action-cudby-130.jpg).
