# Activities

***Delta Tau Delta***
  
  I joined the Fraternity called Delta Tau Delta during my sophmore year. I am currently the out-of-house brotherhood chair. I create events for the house to attend that bring our brothership closer. 
  For example I have set up:
  - Paintball
  - Golf outings
  - Bowling
 
 We recently built a new house.
